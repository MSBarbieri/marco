When adding links which point to resources within git repositories, like KEPs or
supporting documentation, please reference a specific commit and avoid linking
directly to the master branch. This ensures that links reference a specific
point in time, rather than a document that may change over time. See here for
guidance on getting permanent links to files:
`https://help.github.com/en/articles/getting-permanent-links-to-files` Please
use the following format for linking documentation:
- [KEP]: <link>
- [Usage]: <link>
- [Other doc]: <link>

```docs
