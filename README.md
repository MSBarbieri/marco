# Rust/Nix Base Server

this project is a default/template implementation of web server in rust with my
personal default environment and way of developing.

Here i want to make a template where i have the most commons integration in a
web service system, like: ws, webrtc, multiples types of dbs, caching, message
queueing, serder-side rendering, file transfering, tracing, profiling and etc.

## start project.

If you are using nix as a package manager you will need direnv only and run
command `direnv allow`, otherwise you should use container.
